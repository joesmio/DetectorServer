<h2>Using the CQP Detector Server</h2>


<p>
The CQP Detector Server is a system which allows remote data collection from detectors to a variety of platforms.
</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Server</b> - The C++ program running on a computer which is physically connected to the detectors.
    </li><li>
        <b>Listener</b> - The client-side data collector. Any number of Listeners may be connected to the Server, and each one may ask for different data.<br/>For example, if you're running an experiment on channels 1 and 2, you might use the detector web page (that's a listener) to view counts and coincidences, while also connecting a Python or Matlab listener to perform long-term data collection. From home, you may connect via a mobile phone (the web listener), to check that everything's up and running.
    </li><li>
        <b>Setup Data</b> - The data structure (in JSON format) used by the Listener to tell the Server who you are and what you want.
    </li><li>
        <b>Count Data</b> - The requested results (also in JSON format), sent from the Server to the Listener.
    </li><li>
        <b>Bitfield</b> (or <b>bit mask</b>) - A binary number where each bit is used as a binary flag (usually to indicate a detector channel on/off).
    </li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<h2>Data Structures</h2>
All data structures are in human-readable JSON format. They're just text. 
<h3>Setup Data</h3>
Setup Data is used to communicate the current status of the server, and also let the listener make requests for data.<br/>Packed into a single line, it looks like this:
<b><pre>    {"type":"setup","waterloo_data_mode":"timetag","poll_time":1.0,"user_name":"ej","user_platform":"python","timetag_unit_ok":1,"tick_resolution":0.000000,"active_channels":7,"input_threshold_volts":[-0.090000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.240000,-0.210000,-0.170000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000],"channel_delay_ns":[21.875000,0.000000,35.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,47.968750,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,110.000000,100.000000,65.781250,21.718750],"coincidence_channels":[],"coincidence_windows_ns":[],"histogram_channels":0,"histogram_windows_ns":50.000000,"slide_co_all_mask":0,"slide_co_move_mask":0,"slide_co_width":0,"connected_users":["ej","stefano","jez_lab"],"connected_platforms":["python","web","web"],"connected_active_channels":[0,0,61440]}</pre></b>

Here's an item-by-item rundown of what each field means:
<i>
<ul>
<li><b>r:</b> The listener can read this value, but can't change it.</li>
<li><b>w:</b> The listener provides this information to the server.</li>
<li><b>r/w:</b> Both the listener and the server can change this.</li>
</ul>
</i>

    }</b></pre>

<h3>Count Data</h3>
Count Data is sent from the server to the listener, packed up like this:
<b><pre>    {"type":"counts","waterloo_data_mode":"timetag","time":78441.457440,"delta_time":2.402956,"span_time":0.000000,"local_time":"10-11-16 09:16:48","raw_counts":0,"slide_co_counts":[],"coincidence":[],"histogram_counts":[],"counts":[54554,654,0,0,0,6546,0,0,0,0,0,778,0,0,0,0]}</pre></b>

<h2>Communicating With the Server</h2>
Anything which communicates over a network connection can be a listener. Here's how it goes:
<ol>
    <li>
        A listener connects to the server, and sends just one word:
        <b><pre>setup</pre></b>
    </li>
    <li>
        The server sends Setup Data to the listener:
        <b><pre>{"type":"setup","waterloo_data_mode":"timetag","poll_time":1.0,"user_name":"(unknown user)","user_platform":"(unknown platform)","timetag_unit_ok":1,"tick_resolution":0.000000,"active_channels":0,"input_threshold_volts":[-0.090000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.240000,-0.210000,-0.170000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000],"channel_delay_ns":[21.875000,0.000000,35.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,47.968750,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,110.000000,100.000000,65.781250,21.718750],"coincidence_channels":[],"coincidence_windows_ns":[],"histogram_channels":0,"histogram_windows_ns":50.000000,"slide_co_all_mask":0,"slide_co_move_mask":0,"slide_co_width":0,"connected_users":["(unknown user)","stefano","jez_lab"],"connected_platforms":["(unknown platform)","web","web"],"connected_active_channels":[0,0,61440]}
        </pre></b>
    </li>
    <li>
        The listener fills in fields of the Setup Data to indicate who they are and which channels and counts they're interested in, and sends it back to the server.
        <b><pre>{"type":"setup","waterloo_data_mode":"timetag","poll_time":1.0,"user_name":"ej","user_platform":"python","timetag_unit_ok":1,"tick_resolution":0.000000,"active_channels":7,"input_threshold_volts":[-0.090000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.240000,-0.210000,-0.170000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000,-0.200000],"channel_delay_ns":[21.875000,0.000000,35.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,47.968750,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,110.000000,100.000000,65.781250,21.718750],"coincidence_channels":[],"coincidence_windows_ns":[],"histogram_channels":0,"histogram_windows_ns":50.000000,"slide_co_all_mask":0,"slide_co_move_mask":0,"slide_co_width":0,"connected_users":["(unknown user)","stefano","jez_lab"],"connected_platforms":["(unknown platform)","web","web"],"connected_active_channels":[0,0,61440]}
        </pre></b>
    </li>
    <li>
        The server will echo back the Setup Data <b>to all connected listeners</b>, and then begin sending Count Data at the frequency requested by "poll_time". (See above for info details on the data format)<br/>
        <i><b>Note:</b> If poll_time is set to zero, then the server will only send results each time the listener sends the word "counts".</i>
        <b><pre>{"type":"counts","waterloo_data_mode":"timetag","time":78441.457440,"delta_time":2.402956,"span_time":0.000000,"local_time":"10-11-16 09:16:48","raw_counts":0,"slide_co_counts":[],"coincidence":[],"histogram_counts":[],"counts":[54554,654,0,0,0,6546,0,0,0,0,0,778,0,0,0,0]}
        </pre></b>
    </li>
    <li>
        To change the requested data, the listener can send the Setup Data again at any time. If any other user transmits a Setup Data packet, the server will echo the result to all connected users.
    </li>
</ol>
